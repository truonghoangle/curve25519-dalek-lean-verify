# Tests for `linter.curve25519.specIndent`

Tests for the four indentation checks.  The first three checks fire only on `@[step]`
theorems; the proof-body (Check 4) rule fires on every theorem.  Each `#guard_msgs` block
targets exactly one violation so the expected-output annotation stays minimal.

These tests live in the `Tests` Lake library (module `Tests.LinterTest.SpecIndent`) rather
than in the `Curve25519Dalek` library, so the dummy theorems below (and their `@[step]`
registrations) never leak into the production library or its public namespace.  They are
additionally wrapped in the `Curve25519Dalek.Lint.Test` namespace as a second line of
defence.
