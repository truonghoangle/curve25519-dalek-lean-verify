# Curve25519Dalek project linters

Importing this module activates all project-specific linters.  It is imported transitively
by `Curve25519Dalek.Aux` and `Curve25519Dalek.FunsExternal`, which together cover the full
transitive import graph of spec theorem files.

## Linters provided

| Option | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `linter.curve25519.specIndent` | `@[step]` theorem indentation (binders/type/body/proof) |

All linters are enabled by default (`defValue := true`) and can be suppressed locally with a
documented `set_option linter.curve25519.* false in` — consistent with the style guide's
requirement that suppressions carry an explanatory comment.
