/-! # Spec Theorem for `MontgomeryPoint::mul`

Specification and proof for
`curve25519_dalek::montgomery::{core::ops::arith::Mul<&0 (curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar), curve25519_dalek::montgomery::MontgomeryPoint> for &1 (curve25519_dalek::montgomery::MontgomeryPoint)}::mul`.

This function performs scalar multiplication of a Montgomery point using the Montgomery ladder
algorithm. It implements constant-time scalar multiplication by processing scalar bits from
most significant to least significant.

Natural language description:

    • Interprets the MontgomeryPoint's 32-byte encoding as a field element u using
      `FieldElement51.from_bytes`.

    • Initializes two projective points:
      - x0 = (1 : 0) representing the identity (point at infinity)
      - x1 = (u : 1) representing the input point in projective coordinates

    • Processes scalar bits from most significant (bit 254) to least significant (bit 0)
      using the Montgomery ladder (Algorithm 8 from Costello-Smith 2017):
      - By scalar invariant #1, the MSB (bit 255) is always 0, so we start from bit 254
      - For each bit, conditionally swaps x0 and x1 based on bit transitions
      - Applies differential add-and-double operation
      - Maintains constant-time execution through conditional operations

    • After processing all bits, performs a final conditional swap based on the LSB

    • Converts the projective result x0 back to affine coordinates using `ProjectivePoint.as_affine`

Natural language specs:

    • The function always succeeds (no panic) given valid inputs
    • Returns a 32-byte MontgomeryPoint encoding the scalar multiplication result
    • The computation is constant-time with respect to the scalar value
    • The result represents the u-coordinate of [scalar]P on the Montgomery curve
-/
/-- **Spec and proof concerning `montgomery.MulShared1MontgomeryPointShared0ScalarMontgomeryPoint.mul`**:
- No panic (always returns successfully given valid inputs)
- Implements the Montgomery ladder for constant-time scalar multiplication
- Processes scalar bits from bit 254 down to bit 0 using Algorithm 8 (Costello-Smith 2017)
- Mathematical properties of the result:
  * The result encodes the u-coordinate of the scalar multiplication [scalar]P
  * If P has u-coordinate u₀ and scalar is n (as an integer ≤ 2^255), then the result
    encodes u₀([n]P), the u-coordinate of the n-fold sum of P on the Montgomery curve
  * The Montgomery ladder maintains the invariant that x0 and x1 represent points
    differing by P throughout the computation
  * When the scalar is reduced modulo the group order L, the result corresponds to
    scalar multiplication in the prime-order subgroup
  * The result is computed via projective arithmetic and converted back to affine form
  * The returned MontgomeryPoint is a valid 32-byte encoding with value reduced modulo 2^255
  * The computation maintains constant-time guarantees: the sequence of operations
    executed is independent of the scalar bit values (only conditional swaps and
    unconditional arithmetic operations are performed)
