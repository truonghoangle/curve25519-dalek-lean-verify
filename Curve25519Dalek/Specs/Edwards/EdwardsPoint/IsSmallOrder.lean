/-! # Spec Theorem for `EdwardsPoint::is_small_order`

Specification and proof for `EdwardsPoint::is_small_order`.

This function determines if an Edwards point is of small order (i.e., if it is in E[8]).

natural language description:

• Determines whether an EdwardsPoint is in the torsion subgroup E[8]

• A point has small order if multiplying it by the cofactor (= 8) results in the identity element

natural language specs:

• The function always succeeds (no panic)
• Returns `true` if and only if the point is in the torsion subgroup E[8]
• Equivalently, returns `true` iff multiplying by the cofactor yields the identity element

/-- **Spec and proof concerning `edwards.EdwardsPoint.is_small_order`**:
- No panic (always returns successfully)
- Returns `true` if and only if the point has small order (is in the torsion subgroup E[8])
- This is determined by checking if multiplying by the cofactor yields the identity element
