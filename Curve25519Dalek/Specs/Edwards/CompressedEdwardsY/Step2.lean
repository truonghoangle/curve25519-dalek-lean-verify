/-! # Spec Theorem for `CompressedEdwardsY::decompress::step_2`

Specification and proof for the second step of `CompressedEdwardsY::decompress`.

This function performs the final decompression step which:
1. Extracts the sign bit from the compressed representation
2. Conditionally negates the x-coordinate according to the sign bit
3. Computes T = X * Y
4. Returns the complete EdwardsPoint in extended coordinates (X, Y, Z, T)

Natural language description:

    - Takes a CompressedEdwardsY and field elements X, Y, Z from step_1
    - Extracts the sign bit from the high bit of byte 31 of the compressed representation
    - Since sqrt_ratio_i returns the nonnegative square root, conditionally negates X
      according to the sign bit to match the encoded sign
    - Computes T = X * Y (the product of x and y coordinates)
    - Returns an EdwardsPoint with coordinates (X, Y, Z, T)

Natural language specs:

    - The function always succeeds (no panic)
    - The sign bit is extracted from the high bit (bit 7) of byte 31
    - X is conditionally negated: if the sign bit is set, X becomes -X
    - T is computed as the product X * Y (mod p)
    - The returned point has Z unchanged from the input
    - The returned point satisfies T = X * Y (mod p)

/-- **Spec for `edwards.decompress.step_2`**:
- No panic (always returns successfully)
- Returns an EdwardsPoint with coordinates (X', Y, Z, T) where:
  - The sign bit is extracted from bit 7 of byte 31 of the compressed representation
  - X' is conditionally negated based on the sign bit:
    - If sign bit is 0, X' = X
    - If sign bit is 1, X' = -X (mod p)
  - Y and Z are unchanged from the inputs
  - T = X' * Y (mod p)
