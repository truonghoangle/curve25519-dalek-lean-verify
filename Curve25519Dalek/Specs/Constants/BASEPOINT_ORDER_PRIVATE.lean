# Spec theorem for `curve25519_dalek::constants::BASEPOINT_ORDER_PRIVATE`

This constant represents the order of the Ed25519 basepoint and the Ristretto group,
$$
\ell = 2^{252} + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493.
$$

It is stored as a `Scalar` whose `bytes` field is the canonical 32-byte little-endian
encoding of $\ell$. The constant is used internally to check whether an `EdwardsPoint` is
torsion-free (by multiplying the point by `BASEPOINT_ORDER_PRIVATE` and checking for
identity).

/-- **Spec theorem for `curve25519_dalek::constants::BASEPOINT_ORDER_PRIVATE`**
• The byte representation of BASEPOINT_ORDER_PRIVATE, interpreted as a little-endian
  natural number via U8x32_as_Nat, equals the group order L.
• The byte representation is canonical, i.e., U8x32_as_Nat(bytes) < 2^256
  (which follows from the previous property since L < 2^256).
